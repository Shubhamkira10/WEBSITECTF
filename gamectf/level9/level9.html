        <h1>Level 9</h1>
        <p>You've conquered every challenge, proving your resilience, determination, and strength. Just like in this CTF, life may throw complex puzzles your way, but you have the courage and brilliance to solve them all.</p>
        <p>Remember, this battle doesn’t define you—your strength, your spirit, and your will to keep going do. You are not alone in this journey; you have friends who believe in you, stand by you, and cheer for you every step of the way.</p>  
        <p>Keep fighting, keep believing, and never forget—you are stronger than you know.</p>
